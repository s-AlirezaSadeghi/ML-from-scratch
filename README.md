# Machine learning from scratch

In this repository I implement a number of Machine Learning algorithms from scratch. 
In addition, I script a performance comparison against scikit learn
implementations. Be aware that this is a work in progress project.


### Environment setup
**Warning**: if you have had the environment installed previously then execute "conda remove --all --name  ml-from-scratch"</br>

To install the environment for this project follow instructions below.</br>
1- cd into the environment directory</br>
2- Execute "conda env create --file environment.yml"</br>
3- if all goes well, you can activate the environment yb executing "conda activate ml-from-scratch"

To run tests execute " python -m pytest tests -v"
